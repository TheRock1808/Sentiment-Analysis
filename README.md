# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis tool that takes sentences as input and analyzes whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the input sentences.

## Features
- ### Input: Accepts sentences or text inputs for sentiment analysis.
- ### Output: Classifies the sentiment of the input as positive, negative, or neutral.
- ### Pre-processing: Performs text pre-processing steps such as tokenization, lowercasing, and removal of stopwords.
- ### Model: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for sentiment classification.
- ### Accuracy: Provides an accuracy score or metric to evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis.

## Setup
1. ### Requirements:
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, nltk).
2. ### Installation:
   Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. ### Usage:
   Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script and enter a sentence for sentiment analysis.

## Usage
1. ### Input: Enter a sentence for sentiment analysis when prompted.
2. **Output:** The program will output the sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) for the input sentence.

## Example
Input: "I love this product, it's amazing!"
Output: Positive

Input: "This movie was terrible, I hated it."
Output: Negative

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models for improved sentiment analysis.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
- Support for analyzing sentiment in different languages.
