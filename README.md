# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis tool that takes sentences as input and analyzes whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the input sentences.

## Features
 ### Input:
- Accepts sentences or text inputs for sentiment analysis.
 ### Output:
- Classifies the sentiment of the input as positive, negative, or neutral.
 ### Pre-processing:
- Performs text pre-processing steps such as tokenization, lemmatization, lowercasing, and removal of stopwords.
 ### Model:
- Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for sentiment classification (LogisticRegressionCV).
 ### Accuracy:
- Provides an accuracy score or metric to evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis.

## Setup
 ### Requirements:
- Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, nltk).
 ### Installation:
- Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 ### Usage:
- Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script and enter a sentence for sentiment analysis.

## Usage
 ### Input:
- Enter a sentence for sentiment analysis when prompted.
 ### Output:
- The program will output the sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral) for the      input sentence.

## Example
1.  Input: "I love this product, it's amazing!"
> Output: Positive

2. Input: "This movie was terrible, I hated it."
> Output: Negative

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced machine learning models for improved sentiment analysis.
- Try to train the model in deepleaning algorithms.
- Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
- Support for analyzing sentiment in different languages.
